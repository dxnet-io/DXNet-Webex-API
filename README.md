DXNet-Webex-missions
This repo serve to support the webex missions

Webex Missions - Is a laboratory created by DXNet, in order to make students know Cisco DEVNET https://developer.cisco.com .
Cisco DEVNET focuses on software development integrated with CISCO products https://www.cisco.com/c/pt_pt/products/index.html.

In this lab the student will learn how to integrate a cisco products, the cisco product webex teams https://teams.webex.com, using APIs from Cisco DEVNET and DXNet.

To complete the Lab the student will have to:
create a webex teams account https://teams.webex.com. 
The student must enter the main event room via the DXNet API. 
And them the student must ask the DXNet bot, via API for the winner code.
Once the student has obtained the code, he / she must go to the main room of the DXNet event 30º informatics days in webex teams and place the code.
The Code entered will be analyzed and if it is correct the student will be informed that he / she completed the lab successfully.
